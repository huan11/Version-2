STATIC PREDICATES
These predicates do not take any configuration parameters or inputs from the user. These are specified in the scheduler configuration using their exact name.

Default Predicates
The default scheduler policy includes the following predicates:

NoVolumeZoneConflict checks that the volumes a pod requests are available in the zone.


{"name" : "NoVolumeZoneConflict"}
MaxEBSVolumeCount checks the maximum number of volumes that can be attached to an AWS instance.


{"name" : "MaxEBSVolumeCount"}
MaxAzureDiskVolumeCount checks the maximum number of Azure Disk Volumes.


{"name" : "MaxAzureDiskVolumeCount"}
PodToleratesNodeTaints checks if a pod can tolerate the node taints.


{"name" : "PodToleratesNodeTaints"}
CheckNodeUnschedulable checks if a pod can be scheduled on a node with Unschedulable spec.


{"name" : "CheckNodeUnschedulable"}
CheckVolumeBinding evaluates if a pod can fit based on the volumes, it requests, for both bound and unbound PVCs. * For PVCs that are bound, the predicate checks that the corresponding PVâ€™s node affinity is satisfied by the given node. * For PVCs that are unbound, the predicate searched for available PVs that can satisfy the PVC requirements and that the PV node affinity is satisfied by the given node.

The predicate returns true if all bound PVCs have compatible PVs with the node, and if all unbound PVCs can be matched with an available and node-compatible PV.


{"name" : "CheckVolumeBinding"}
NoDiskConflict checks if the volume requested by a pod is available.


{"name" : "NoDiskConflict"}
MaxGCEPDVolumeCount checks the maximum number of Google Compute Engine (GCE) Persistent Disks (PD).


{"name" : "MaxGCEPDVolumeCount"}
MaxCSIVolumeCountPred

MatchInterPodAffinity checks if the pod affinity/anti-affinity rules permit the pod.


{"name" : "MatchInterPodAffinity"}
Other Static Predicates
OpenShift Container Platform also supports the following predicates:

The CheckNode-* predicates cannot be used if the Taint Nodes By Condition feature is enabled. The Taint Nodes By Condition feature is enabled by default.

CheckNodeCondition checks if a pod can be scheduled on a node reporting out of disk, network unavailable, or not ready conditions.


{"name" : "CheckNodeCondition"}
CheckNodeLabelPresence checks if all of the specified labels exist on a node, regardless of their value.


{"name" : "CheckNodeLabelPresence"}
checkServiceAffinity checks that ServiceAffinity labels are homogeneous for pods that are scheduled on a node.


{"name" : "checkServiceAffinity"}
PodToleratesNodeNoExecuteTaints checks if a pod tolerations can tolerate a node NoExecute taints.


{"name" : "PodToleratesNodeNoExecuteTaints"}
